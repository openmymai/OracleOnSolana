## Oracle and Oracle Networks

Oracles are services that provide external data to a blockchain network. 
Blockchains are siloed environments that do not inherently know the outside world. 
Oracles solve this limitation by offering a decentralized way to get various types of data onchain, such as:

- Results of sporting events
- Weather data
- Political election results
- Market data
- Randomness

While the implementation may differ across blockchains, oracles generally work as follows:

Data is sourced offchain.
The data is published onchain via a transaction and stored in an account.
Programs can read the data stored in the account and use it in the program's logic.

## Trust and Oracle Networks
The primary challenge for oracles is trust. Since blockchains execute irreversible financial transactions, 
developers and users need to trust the validity and accuracy of oracle data. The first step in trusting an oracle is understanding its implementation.

Broadly speaking, there are three types of implementations:

1. Single, centralized oracle publishes data onchain.
**Pro**: It's simple; there's one source of truth.
**Con**: Nothing prevents the oracle provider from supplying inaccurate data.

2. Network of oracles publishes data, with consensus determining the final result.
**Pro**: Consensus reduces the likelihood of bad data being pushed onchain.
**Con**: There's no direct disincentive for bad actors to publish incorrect data to sway consensus.

3. Oracle network with proof-of-stake mechanism: Oracles are required to stake tokens to participate.
If an oracle's response deviates too far from the consensus, its stake is taken by the protocol and it can no longer report.
**Pro**: This approach prevents any single oracle from overly influencing the final result while incentivizing honest and accurate reporting.
**Con**: Building decentralized networks is challenging; proper incentives and sufficient participation are necessary for success.

## Summary
- Oracles are services that provide external data to a blockchain network.
- Solana has a rich ecosystem of oracle providers. Some notable oracle providers include Pyth Network, Switchboard, Chainlink, and DIA.
- You can build your own oracle to create a custom data feed.
- When choosing oracle providers, consider reliability, accuracy, decentralization, update frequency, and cost. 
Be aware of security risks: oracles can be potential points of failure or attack. For critical data, use reputable providers and consider multiple independent oracles to mitigate risks.
